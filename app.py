        There is a problem called **"Storrowing Problem"**. Use the AI tool below to understand the problem and find a solution for a creative advertisement to solve this.

        ### Instructions:
        The AI tool cannot create a full advertisement. A broad storyboard of how the advertisement would look would be sufficient. You would have to interact with the AI tool below to understand the problem and ask the right questions and give appropriate prompts to generate the outline/storyboard of an effective advertisement.

        Whenever you are ready, start giving the inputs in the input box and click on "Generate". The AI tool will generate answers to your question. When you are happy with the solution, paste the solution in the Qualtrics link.
